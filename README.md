# Advanced Statistical Inference

Teaching material (and more)

In this repository you may find the R code to reproduce the statistical analysis of the network lawyers, as related to the set of slides having name "Network.pdf" and available on Moodle (at UNIGE). The analysis and the code are available in the html file Lazega.Rmd: an R markdown file. You may dowload it and open it in R Studio. Then create the html file using <tt> knit </tt> (see the file Screenshot_GetHTML.png) and open it using your borwser. I've also created the Lazega.html file.
